    <!-- <h1>A heading</h1> for your most important heading
    <h2>A sub-heading</h2> for a heading at the next level
    <h3>A sub-sub-heading</h3> â€¦and so on, up to <h6>
    <p>A paragraph of text</p>
    <em>text</em> emphasizes your text
    <strong>text</strong> strongly emphasizes your text
    <br> goes to another line (you can't put anything inside br and there's no closing tag)
    <a href="https://djangogirls.org">link</a> creates a link
    <ul><li>first item</li><li>second item</li></ul> makes a list, just like this one!
    <div></div> defines a section of the page

        <!-- the notation means that we are using Django template tags. This time we will use one that will create a URL for us!The post_detail part means that Django will be expecting a URL in blog/urls.py with name=post_detailAnd how about pk=post.pk? pk is short for primary key, which is a unique name for each record in a database. Because we didn't specify a primary key in our Post model, Django creates one for us (by default, a number that increases by one for each record, i.e. 1, 2, 3) and adds it as a field named pk to each of our posts. We access the primary key by writing post.pk, the same way we access other fields (title, author, etc.) in our Post object! -->

        {% endblock %}
        <!-- We are accessing data in each of the fields defined in our Post model. Also, the |linebreaksbr is piping the posts text through a filter to convert line-breaks into paragraphs -->
